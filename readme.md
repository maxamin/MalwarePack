## 🔍 Analysis Guide
### Static Analysis Workflow
1. **Initial Triage**
   ```bash
   python mast_analyzer.py --file sample.exe --vt-api YOUR_KEY
   ```

2. **YARA Rule Creation**
   ```yara
   rule APT28_Loader {
       meta:
           author = "Analyst"
           date = "2025-01-25"
       strings:
           $magic = { 4D 5A 90 00 }
           $str1 = "C2_Connect" wide
       condition:
           $magic at 0 and filesize < 2MB and $str1
   }
   ```

### Dynamic Analysis Checklist
- [ ] Disable Windows Defender
- [ ] Configure FakeNet-NG 
- [ ] Capture PCAP with Wireshark
- [ ] Monitor process injection with Process Hacker

#### Network Analysis Example
```bash
tcpdump -i any -w malware.pcap -vv
```
