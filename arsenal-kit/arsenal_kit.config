include_artifact_kit="true"

## Reflective Loader Size in KB
# Valid values are 0, 5, and 100
#
# For Cobalt Strike version 4.8 and earlier the value 0 is the same as 5
# For Cobalt Strike version 4.9 and later the value 0 indicates you want
# a beacon dll without a reflective loader to be used with a prepended
# loader (sRDI/Double Pulsar).
#
# This setting affects the urdl_kit and artifact_kit.  The recommendation
# is to use either the value of 5 or 100.  The reason is the udrl_kit
# only supports the stomped "Stephen Fewer" style loader which requires
# the value of 5 or 100.  The artifact_kit only uses this information to
# validate that the artifactkit_stage_size is a minimum size or larger.
# The value of 0 or 5 uses the same minimum size while the value of 100
# uses a larger size.
rdll_size=5

#### Artifact kit options

# Artifact technique (see readme in Artifact for details)
# Only specify a single bypass technique for the arsenal kit, no spaces are allowed.
# Options are: mailslot, peek, pipe, readfile, readfile-v2, template
artifactkit_technique="pipe"

# Artifact reflective loader allocator
# Set how the artifact allocates memory for the reflective loader.
# Options are: HeapAlloc, VirtualAlloc, and MapViewOfFile
artifactkit_allocator="HeapAlloc"

# Artifact stage_size 
# 5kb   User Defined Reflective Loader size: 310272
# 100kb User Defined Reflective Loader size: 444928
# Choose the size based on the rdll_size setting.
# Note if using a prepended loader (sRDI/Double Pulsar) the size needs to
# include the loader and beacon sizes, which likely will be larger than the
# 5kb size.
artifactkit_stage_size=310272

# Add the resource.rc to the .exe or .dll payloads?
# The resoucre.rc adds binary metadata and icon
artifactkit_include_resource="true"

# Compile stack spoofing av bypass technique ?
# For additional information see: kits/artifact/README_STACK_SPOOF.md
# This uses the Microsoft Fiber functions to implemnt stack spoofing.
# This is not compatible with the evasive_sleep capabilities provided
# by the sleep mask kit.
artifactkit_stack_spoof="true"

# Artifacts will use the standard windows api or the specified system call method
# using one of the following:
#    none                - artifacts will use standard windows api functions
#    embedded            - artifacts will use syscalls using the embedded
#                          method.  This method will likely be signatured
#                          by AV products.
#    indirect            - artifacts will use syscalls using the indirect
#                          method.
#    indirect_randomized - artifacts will use syscalls using the indirect
#                          randomized method.
# Options are: none, embedded, indirect, indirect_randomized
artifactkit_syscalls_method="none"

#### Sleepmask kit options

# NOTE: The evasive sleep capabilities can only be enabled by modifying
#       code in the Sleepmask code.
#       For additional information see: kits/sleepmask/README.md

# Sleepmask Version
# Set which version of Sleepmask is to be generated
# Options are: 47, 49
#   47 - Supports Cobalt Strike 4.7 and 4.8
#   49 - Supports Cobalt Strike 4.9 and later
sleepmask_version="49"

# Sleepmask Sleep method for the default beacon type
# Set which function to use when sleeping
# Options are: Sleep, WaitForSingleObject
#   Sleep should be used when artifactkit_stack_spoof is set to true to
#   allow for the hook on Sleep to work.
sleepmask_sleep_method="Sleep"

# Sleepmask Mask the text section of beacon
# This determines if the text section of beacon should be masked when sleeping.
# It is recommended to set the stage.userwx profile setting to false.
# This capability will modifying the memory protection and mask/unmask the
# text section of beacon.
# NOTE: if the stage.userwx is set to true then sleep mask will mask the
#       text section, however the memory protection will remain RWX.
sleepmask_mask_text_section="false"

# Sleepmask will use the standard windows api or the specified system call
# method when masking the text section of beacon.
# Only supported with the following settings:
#    sleepmask_mask_text_section="true"
#
# Supported system call methods:
#    none                - sleepmask will use standard windows api functions
#    embedded            - sleepmask will use syscalls using the embedded
#                          method.
#    indirect            - sleepmask will use syscalls using the indirect
#                          method.
#    indirect_randomized - sleepmask will use syscalls using the indirect
#                          randomized method.
# Options are: none, embedded, indirect, indirect_randomized
sleepmask_syscalls_method="none"
