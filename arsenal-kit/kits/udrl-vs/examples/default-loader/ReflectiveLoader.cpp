        * This is subject to change depending upon the compiler/compiler settings. This could result
        * in issues with Beacon/the postex DLL's cleanup routines. As a result, when writing x86 loaders
        * we strongly recommend verifying that the correct value is subtracted from the result of 
        * GetLocation(). GetLocation() will return the address of the instruction following
        * the function call. In the example below, GetLocation() returns 0x0000000E which is why 
        * we subtract 0xE to get back to 0x0. In our testing, this value can change and can sometimes 
        * cause crashes during cleanup.
